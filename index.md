**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** 

I find our domain especially interesting because we’re analyzing time-series data to search for neutrinoless double beta decay which is a process that could confirm neutrinos are their own antiparticles and help explain why matter exists in the universe. The most fascinating part of this topic for me so far has been learning about different waveform transformations, such as pole-zero correction, Fourier transforms, and gradient analysis, and how we can extract various parameters to distinguish between SSE and MSE events. By effectively rejecting MSEs, we can improve our search sensitivity and increase the likelihood of detecting this rare process.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** 

I would like to analyze my newly extracted and future parameters to evaluate how effectively they distinguish between SSE and MSE events and contribute to improving the classification model. I also plan to apply these parameters to waveform samples to observe how well they separate SSE and MSE and identify potential patterns or trends. Additionally, I want to investigate the correlations and explainability among different parameters to determine which ones are most important, helping to guide which parameters should be included in future analytical methods.

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?** 

I would like to explore additional waveform transformations to extract more meaningful parameters for our potential classification model. I’m also interested in understanding how different parameters can be combined to enhance classification performance. Moving forward, I want to take a more creative approach to developing parameters by thinking from a deeper physics perspective rather than relying solely on visual observations of the graphs, while still recognizing that graphical analysis is an important aspect of the physics viewpoint.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?** 

We will be building the ML models in Quarter 2 so in the future, I am interested in experimenting with different classification ML models, such as random forests, SVMs, or neural networks, to compare their performance in distinguishing SSE and MSE events. I want to explore dimensionality reduction and feature selection methods, like PCA or SHAP, to understand parameter relationships better and see which features matter most. I also would be interested in combining models as suggested in the paper we are using for our project.
